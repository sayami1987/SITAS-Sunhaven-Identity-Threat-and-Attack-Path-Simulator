# SITAS Security Policy Alignment Pack

## Purpose

This folder explains how the **Sunhaven Identity Threat and Attack-Path Simulator (SITAS)** aligns with the wider Sunhaven Care security-policy framework and with recognised cybersecurity policy guidance.

These files are **not a second set of organisational Sunhaven policies**. The wider Sunhaven Care project policy set remains the source of organisational policy requirements.

The purpose of this folder is to show how SITAS:

- models risks that are relevant to the Sunhaven policy framework;
- simulates selected security controls;
- tests whether those controls block modelled attack paths;
- uses synthetic data and safe offline testing;
- records repeatable evidence for the capstone project.

---

## Current SITAS Implementation Verified

The current repository contains:

```text
6 threat scenarios
6 simulated security controls
directed graph modelling
Breadth-First Search attack-path discovery
configurable 5 × 5 risk model
45 passing automated pytest tests
manual OPEN/BLOCKED evidence for all six scenarios
```

SITAS operates as a standalone Python/JSON simulator. It does not configure Microsoft Entra, call Microsoft Graph, modify real accounts, enforce real device compliance, or use real resident information.

## Files in This Folder

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `01-SITAS-policy-alignment.md` | Maps SITAS scenarios and controls to the Sunhaven policy areas and relevant SANS guidance |
| `02-SITAS-secure-development-and-testing-standard.md` | Defines secure development and testing expectations for SITAS |
| `03-SITAS-risk-and-control-validation-standard.md` | Defines how scenario risk and simulated-control outcomes are assessed |
| `04-SITAS-evidence-and-data-handling-standard.md` | Defines synthetic-data, secret-handling and evidence requirements |
| `05-SITAS-control-mapping-register.md` | Provides a concise traceable mapping from scenario to control, requirement, implementation and evidence |

## Relationship to the Wider Sunhaven Policy Set

The formal Sunhaven Care policy set currently covers these major areas:

- **POL-01 – Access Management**
- **POL-02 – Workforce Identity Lifecycle**
- **POL-03 – Authentication and Shared Device Security**

SITAS does not replace these policies. It provides an analytical simulator that demonstrates why related controls matter.

Example:

```text
Sunhaven Policy Requirement
        ↓
Identity Security Control
        ↓
SITAS Threat Scenario
        ↓
Attack Path
        ↓
Risk Assessment
        ↓
Control Simulation
        ↓
OPEN or BLOCKED
        ↓

## Important Scope Statement

SITAS demonstrates the **modelled effect** of security controls.

A result such as:

```text
MFA OFF → OPEN
MFA ON  → BLOCKED
```

means the implemented SITAS rule blocks that modelled attack path.

It does **not** mean that SITAS has enabled MFA in Microsoft Entra or proven that every possible real-world attack path has been eliminated.

This distinction must be maintained in project documentation, evidence and demonstrations.
